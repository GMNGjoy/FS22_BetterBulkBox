# Better Bulk Boxes
IF you can't manage to use my [Fieldwork Fill Station](https://github.com/GMNGjoy/FS22_FieldworkFillStation) (why not!), I'd like to offer you another option to purchase pallets of bulk materials that you may need around your farm - with the same 30% discount!


## Description from the ModDesc

Tired of those small Mineral Feed Pallets when feeding 500 cows? Wish you could just buy TMR from the store? The Better Bulk Box Pack has you covered.
